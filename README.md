it is the competition from this link https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data, 
and I have improved the overall accuracy a little bit.

This paper argues that it is more reasonable to think about rental vehicles in terms of months, because temperature and humidity change and there will be transition periods at the alternation of different seasons. This paper eliminates the month factor for prediction and finds that the random forest score=0.40399, which is better. But the decision tree algorithm score=0.53742, the performance decreases.
